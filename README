REQUIRMENTS: 
	-Perl needs to be installed.
	-MySQL needs to be installed.
	-The DBI perl module may need to be installed.
	-The XML::LibXML::Reader will need to be installed. 

INSTALLATION:
-Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
    Libxml2-dev and libxml2 are c libraries that are needed by XML::LibXML::Reader. Or you will have issues.
        a) sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev 
        b) sudo apt-get install libxml2
    Once the libraries are installed then install libxml-libxml-perl to install XML::LibXML::Reader. Or
    you could simply intall the module via cpan.
        c) sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
    Another library that may be needed is zlib. I would recommend installing this library if you want to 
    use other xml related modules.
        d) sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
