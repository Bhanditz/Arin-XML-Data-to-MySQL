REQUIRMENTS: 
	-Perl needs to be installed.
	-A database needs to be installed. (Right now we have only tested with MySQL)
	-The DBIx::Class module needs to be installed.
        -The DBIx::Class::Schema has a 'deploy' feature.
        -The XML::LibXML::Reader will need to be installed. 

INSTALLATION:
-Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
    Libxml2-dev and libxml2 are c libraries that are needed by XML::LibXML::Reader. Or you will have issues.
        a) sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev 
        b) sudo apt-get install libxml2
    Once the libraries are installed then install libxml-libxml-perl to install XML::LibXML::Reader. Or
    you could simply intall the module via cpan.
        c) sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
    Another library that may be needed is zlib. I would recommend installing this library if you want to 
    use other xml related modules.
        d) sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    You will also need the DBIx::Class modules. 
        e) cpan DBIx::Class.

OTHER TOOLS:
    Another usefull tool is dbicdump.pl. This script takes an existing database and dumps it into it into a set of modules that inherit from DBIx::Class::Schema and DBIx::Class::Core. This is the command I used on my test database. 
    -perl dbicdump.pl -o dump_directory=oldbulkwhoisdump -o components='["InflateColumn::DateTime"]' MyApp::Schema dbi:mysql:arin root 12345
   

EXECUTION:
