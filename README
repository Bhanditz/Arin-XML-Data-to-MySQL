REQUIRMENTS: 
	-Perl needs to be installed.
	-A database management system needs to be installed. 
        -DBIx::Class module needs to be installed. 
        -DBIx::Class::Schema has a 'deploy' feature. 
        -XML::LibXML::Reader         
        -XML::Simple needs to be installed.
        -XML::LibXML::SAX or XML::SAX   # Useing these two modules with XML::Simple
        -XML::SAX::ParserFactory        # makes things run faster but it hasn't been implemented. 

INSTALLATION:
-Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
    Libxml2-dev and libxml2 are c libraries that are needed by XML::LibXML::Reader. Or you will have issues.
        a) sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev 
        b) sudo apt-get install libxml2
    Once the libraries are installed then install libxml-libxml-perl to install XML::LibXML::Reader. Or
    you could simply intall the module via cpan.
        c) sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
    Another library that may be needed is zlib. I would recommend installing this library if you want to 
    use other xml related modules.
        d) sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    You will also need the DBIx::Class modules. 
        e) cpan DBIx::Class.

OTHER TOOLS:
    Another usefull tool is dbicdump.pl. This script takes an existing database and dumps it into it into a set of modules that inherit from DBIx::Class::Schema and DBIx::Class::Core. This is the command I used on my test database. 
    -perl dbicdump.pl -o dump_directory=oldbulkwhoisdump -o components='["InflateColumn::DateTime"]' MyApp::Schema dbi:mysql:arin root 12345
   
TODO:
    2) See if project can be added into the Arin project community.
    4) Check for unexpexted elements. Log it to a file.
    5) Add more advanced installation and running instructions to the readme.
    6) Pass verbosity veriable to other perl files.
